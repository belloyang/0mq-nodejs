NOTE; 2019-11-07

This folder (gzip-1.0.0) contains source files meant to enable a gzip-style
interface to zlib. The precise origin of these source files is not known.

These files are presently _not_ used in customer-facing application software.
They are used only in the harvester CLI application, which is intended for use
by Nanometrics personnel only to enable software development.
